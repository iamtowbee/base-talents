# Base Talents
Base Talents is an onchain builder's app. It matches African builders to opportunities onchain starting with bounties. For employers to publish bounties, they use the create bounty button to set the details of a task and fund their accounts to pay the offered rewards into our rewards escrow contract. Builders get to apply by making submissions with their implementation of the published tasks in bounties. After this employer gets to release their rewards to the best submissions via the escrow contract.

## Use Case
This helps us bring more talents onchain as talent is equally distributed but oppurtunity is not.
